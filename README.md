# Common Company vcards

I got tired of wanting to use the contact images feature of Apple Mail and Sparrow, and seeing just a bunch of blank squares.

The images in the vcards are a work in progress.  Where a company has an official Press page where they host their own logos and guidelines, I've tried to use them.  (YouTube is an exception at present.)

Current list of company cards:

* Apple Inc.
* Axis
* Best Buy Reward Zone
* Capital One
* Cox Communications
* GitHub
* Guru.com
* iTunes Store
* Mint
* PayPal
* Steam
* YouTube
