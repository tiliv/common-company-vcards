# Common Company vcards

I got tired of wanting to use the contact images feature of Apple Mail and Sparrow, and seeing just a bunch of blank squares.

# To Install
Download the [vcf file](https://github.com/tiliv/common-company-vcards/archive/master.zip).  You can probably just double-click the multi-card file and your system will do the right thing.

Alternately, you can look through the ``cards/`` folder for the individual cards and import them as you see fit.

# Current list

The images in the vcards are a work in progress.  Where a company has an official Press page where they host their own logos and guidelines, I've tried to use them.  (YouTube is an exception at present.)
